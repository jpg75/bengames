Behavioral economics inspired games.

This package implements a simple Agent Based simulation engine to explore a set of behavioral economics problems
which are tightly related with human cognition. A prototypical game in this area is a card game called 'Target 
the Two' (by Cohen & Bacdayan).

The engine is implemented in pure Java on top of the Processing framework (i.e., no PDE(-X) tricks).
